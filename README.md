# BigBazar
This project created with Spring 4 + Hibernate 4 + Hibernate Spatial + PostGis and Hadoop functionality.
Aim:
To provide the free home delivery option with GIS compatibility. I put the project on public domain so that users can access and give
more valuable comments/code in it.
Added capability of PostGIS can be changed to Oracle Spatial, Pitney Bowes MapInfo.

Architecture:
First created many Micoservices. Each microservices are bundled with one Web Services in controller. These services are exposed to 
other devices. As JQuery's Ajax can work with any devices and so is our services. Ultimate aim is to make platform and
device independent.
